# NYT Article Search - React

This is an single page, MERN-stack application that finds articles from the New York Times using their search API. 

Users can search for a topic and save articles from the results on the "search" page. They can also delete articles that have been saved from the "saved" page. I enjoy writing straightforward applications that do a good job at the task they are developed for!

The app features a Node.js/Express.js backend with a MongoDB/Mongoose database (using mLab while deployed on Heroku). I used Axios for in-app routing and for calling the NYT API with  user-input search terms.

The main purpose of this application was to get comfortable with writing in React. Completing the project helped me see the power of React for writing frontend code and enabled me to better contribute to other applications and team projects.

Here's a demo of the app in use:
